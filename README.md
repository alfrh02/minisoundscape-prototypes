All included sound files are from freesound.org unless stated otherwise

Selected prototypes for year 2 BSc Creative Computing project "Minisoundscape" report. This repository is probably very large as I've included most of the prototype content (such as binary files, sound files, makefiles, etc.). I've trimmed it down by removing VSCode files, obj folders, and general fluff regardless. Folders 4 and 5 do not contain any binaries to run.

The following are referenced in the report:
- "00 VANILLA OPENFRAMEWORKS" is the first soundscape prototype - implements soundbites, ambient sounds, etc.
- "01 MINIAUDIO-SDL2" is the first miniaudio & sdl2 prototype - this is the result of some iteration in slowly understanding SDL2 and bringing in Miniaudio - also compiled with Emscripten
- "02 MINIAUDIO-OPENFRAMEWORKS" is the first use of Miniaudio and openFrameworks together. Intended to be a waveform display and nothing more.
- "03 MA-OF-SOUNDSCAPE" is the first creation of a soundscape using Miniaudio and openFrameworks. User can change soundscape by moving on the grid.
- "04 MINISOUNDSCAPE-V1" is the first draft of Minisoundscape and lacks several features such as spatialisation, and is also less optimised and worsely formatted\n
- "05 MINISOUNDSCAPE-V2" is a rewrite of the above, with optimisations, spatialisation, and better formatting
